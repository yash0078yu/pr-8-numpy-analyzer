# NumPy Analyzer

## Project Overview
The **NumPy Analyzer** is a simple Python program that allows users to perform common data operations, statistical analyses, and mathematical computations on Numpy arrays. The program uses **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to structure code with classes and methods.

## Features
- Create 1D, 2D, or 3D arrays
- Perform element-wise mathematical operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Combine arrays vertically
- Search, sort, and filter array elements
- Compute aggregates: sum, mean, median, standard deviation, variance

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy library

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install NumPy: `pip install numpy`
3. Run the program: `python numpy_analyzer.py`
4. Follow the on-screen menu to perform operations.
